# vector_tile_renderer

A vector tile renderer for use in creating map tile images or writing to a canvas.
Written in Dart to enable use of vector tiles with Flutter.

## Example

An example of output:

* Label sizing and collisions (overlap)
* Theme layer types not implemented: raster, circle, fill-extrusion, heatmap, hillshade, sky
